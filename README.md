# **Online Retail Sales Data Analysis 🚀**  
📊 *A machine learning-driven analysis of online retail sales to forecast trends, predict customer retention, and segment customers.*  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project analyzes an **Online Retail Sales Dataset** using **machine learning models** to gain insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and retention strategies. The analysis covers:  
- **Sales Forecasting** (Regression) 📈  
- **Customer Retention Prediction** (Classification) 🎯  
- **Customer Segmentation** (Clustering) 🔍  

## **📁 Dataset**  
- The dataset includes transactional data with features such as **InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country**.  
- **Data Source**: [Kaggle - Online Retail Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/online-retail-sales-dataset/data)  

## **⚙️ Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - **Regression**: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor  
  - **Classification**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
  - **Clustering**: K-Means  

## **📊 Methodology**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Data transformation & feature engineering  
   - Removing outliers  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding customer buying behavior  
   - Visualizing sales trends and patterns  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - **Regression**: Predicting future sales  
   - **Classification**: Identifying high-retention customers  
   - **Clustering**: Grouping similar customers  

## **📌 Key Findings**  
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: The dataset shows a strong seasonal trend, with peak sales occurring during festive periods.  
- **Customer Segmentation**: The **K-Means clustering** model identified three major customer groups:  
  1. **Frequent High-Value Buyers** – Customers who make repeated purchases with high total spending.  
  2. **Occasional Buyers** – Customers who purchase infrequently but with moderate spending.  
  3. **One-Time Shoppers** – Customers who make a single purchase and never return.  
- **Customer Retention Prediction**: The classification model achieved **85% accuracy** in predicting customer retention, helping businesses identify potential repeat buyers.  
- **Sales Forecasting**: The **Random Forest Regressor** model provided accurate short-term sales predictions, assisting in inventory planning.  


## **📜 Future Improvements**  
- Enhance feature selection for better model accuracy
- Implement deep learning for improved predictions
- Deploy models via a web dashboard
