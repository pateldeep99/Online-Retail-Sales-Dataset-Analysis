Online Retail Sales Data Analysis 🚀
📊 A machine learning-driven analysis of online retail sales to forecast trends, predict customer retention, and segment customers.

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes an Online Retail Sales Dataset using machine learning models to gain insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and retention strategies. The analysis covers:

Sales Forecasting (Regression) 📈
Customer Retention Prediction (Classification) 🎯
Customer Segmentation (Clustering) 🔍
📁 Dataset
The dataset includes transactional data with features such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.
Data Source: Kaggle - Online Retail Sales Dataset
⚙️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 🐍
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning Models:
Regression: Linear Regression
Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier
Clustering: K-Means
📊 Methodology
Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values
Data transformation & feature engineering
Removing outliers
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding customer buying behavior
Visualizing sales trends and patterns
Model Training & Evaluation

Regression: Predicting future sales
Classification: Identifying high-retention customers
Clustering: Grouping similar customers
📌 Key Findings
Sales Trend Analysis: The dataset shows a strong seasonal trend, with peak sales occurring during festive periods.
Customer Segmentation: The K-Means clustering model identified three major customer groups:
Frequent High-Value Buyers – Customers who make repeated purchases with high total spending.
Occasional Buyers – Customers who purchase infrequently but with moderate spending.
One-Time Shoppers – Customers who make a single purchase and never return.
Customer Retention Prediction: The classification model achieved 85% accuracy in predicting customer retention, helping businesses identify potential repeat buyers.
Sales Forecasting: The Random Forest Regressor model provided accurate short-term sales predictions, assisting in inventory planning.
